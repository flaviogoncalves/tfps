# FreePBX Integration Guide

FPS is a simple system to protect your PBX from fraudulent calls. It is very easy to integrate to your PBX. After creating your account and setting your calling policies, you will need to configure your FreePBX (Elastix, Trixbox and others). FPS works like a SIP Provider, but instead of completing your call, it redirects your call back with a three character prefix. After receiving this prefix, you can decide what to do in your dial plan. Below a series of steps required to implement the FPS on FreePBX.

## Method #1 Redirect

To integrate FPS with FreePBX you need:

1 - Add a trunk to FPS
2 -	Add a trunk to PSTN
3 - Add the FPS code to extensions_custom.conf

Step 1: Add a trunk to FPS

Name the trunk “fps” and fill the PEER details replacing <username> and <password> by your accounting data. Leave the USER details empty.



 
Step 2: Add the FPS instructions to /etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf

```
[from-internal-custom]
exten => h,1,Hangup()
include => agentlogin
include => conferences
include => calendar-event
include => weather-wakeup
include => tfpsdial

[tfpsdial]
exten=_011[1-9].,1,set(GROUP()=fps)
same=>n,set(ncalls=${GROUP_COUNT(fps)})
same=>n,set(_original=${EXTEN})
same=>n,SIPAddHeader(P-tfps: ${CALLERID(num)};${SIPDOMAIN};${CHANNEL(recvip)};${CHANNEL(useragent)};${ncalls})
same=>n,set(_original=${EXTEN})
same=>n,dial(SIP/tfps/${FILTER(0-9,${EXTEN:2})})
same=>n,playback(ss-noservice);

[tfps]
;For calls approved, they will receive a redirect and get to the tfps context
exten=_A.,1,Answer()
same=>n,set(OUTBOUND_TRUNK=SIP/International) ; Set here your PSTN trunk same=>n,Dial(${OUTBOUND_TRUNK}/${original})
same=>n,hangup(16)

Response Codes
A00 – Call Approved
